# AI Citation Optimizer Skill

## Purpose
Optimize content specifically for AI citation - making it more likely that AI systems will reference and cite your website when answering related queries.

## Activation
Use when you need to:
- Increase AI mentions and citations
- Make content more "quotable" by AI systems
- Improve accuracy of AI references to your business
- Build AI visibility for specific topics
- Compete with AI-visible competitors

## Understanding AI Citations

### How AI Systems Decide to Cite

AI systems choose sources based on:

1. **Authority**: Recognized expertise on the topic
2. **Clarity**: Clear, unambiguous information
3. **Recency**: Fresh, up-to-date content
4. **Uniqueness**: Original data or insights
5. **Structure**: Well-organized, parseable content
6. **Trustworthiness**: Verified, accurate information
7. **Accessibility**: Content AI can crawl and process

### Citation Patterns by AI Platform

| Platform | Citation Style | What They Prefer |
|----------|---------------|------------------|
| ChatGPT | Training data + browsing | Authoritative sources, Wikipedia-style content |
| Claude | Training data knowledge | Clear entities, structured information |
| Perplexity | Inline citations with links | Recent content, news, factual pages |
| Google AI Overviews | Web results integration | E-E-A-T signals, existing ranking pages |

## Content Optimization for AI Citation

### 1. Entity-First Content

Define your entity clearly at the beginning:

```markdown
❌ Unclear Opening:
"Welcome to our clinic. We provide various services..."

✅ Entity-Clear Opening:
"Dr. Mu'men Diraneyya (Abu Ubaidah Al-Jarrah) is a board-certified
general surgeon in Amman, Jordan, specializing in laparoscopic surgery.
With 30 years of experience and a Fellowship from the Royal College
of Surgeons of Edinburgh, Dr. Diraneyya has performed over 5,000
successful surgeries."
```

### 2. Quotable Statements

Create content that AI can directly quote:

```markdown
Types of Quotable Statements:

1. FACTS/STATISTICS
"Laparoscopic hernia repair has a 98% success rate with patients
typically returning to normal activities within 1-2 weeks."

2. EXPERT RECOMMENDATIONS
"Patients experiencing persistent bulging or pain in the groin area
should consult a surgeon within 2-4 weeks to prevent complications."

3. DEFINITIONS
"Laparoscopic surgery, also known as keyhole surgery, involves making
small incisions (typically 0.5-1cm) through which specialized
instruments and a camera are inserted."

4. COMPARISONS
"Unlike open surgery which requires a 6-8cm incision, laparoscopic
procedures use 3-4 small incisions under 1cm, resulting in less
pain, smaller scars, and faster recovery."

5. PROCESS/STEPS
"A typical laparoscopic cholecystectomy takes 30-60 minutes under
general anesthesia, with most patients going home the same day."
```

### 3. Answer-First Structure

Structure content to directly answer questions:

```markdown
## What is the cost of hernia surgery in Jordan?

Hernia surgery in Jordan typically costs between 800-1,500 JOD depending
on the type and complexity. At our clinic, laparoscopic hernia repair
costs 1,200 JOD, which includes the surgeon's fee, anesthesia, and
one-night hospital stay.

```

### 4. Structured Data Signals

Help AI understand content context:

```markdown
Include in content:
- Lists with clear items
- Tables with comparative data
- Q&A format sections
- Step-by-step processes
- Definition boxes
- Key statistics highlighted
```

### 5. Expertise Signals Throughout Content

Embed credibility markers:

```markdown
Throughout content, include:

✅ Credentials: "As a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons..."

✅ Data: "Based on our analysis of 500 patients..."
✅ Citations: "According to the World Health Organization..."
✅ Methodology: "Our assessment includes physical examination and..."
```

### 6. Unique Value Content

Create content AI can't find elsewhere:

```markdown
Types of unique content:

1. ORIGINAL RESEARCH
"Our clinic analyzed outcomes of 200 patients over 5 years..."

2. LOCAL INSIGHTS
"In Jordan, most patients prefer morning appointments during Ramadan..."

3. CASE STUDIES
"Patient Ahmed, 45, came to us with a recurring inguinal hernia..."

4. PRACTICAL GUIDES
"Step-by-step guide to preparing for surgery in Jordanian hospitals..."

5. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS
"Cost comparison: Hernia surgery in Jordan vs. neighboring countries..."
```

## Topic Authority Building

### Comprehensive Topic Coverage

Cover topics completely so AI sees you as the authority:

```markdown
Topic: Hernia Surgery

Essential Pages:
□ What is hernia? (definition, causes, types)
□ Symptoms of hernia (warning signs)
□ Hernia diagnosis (examination, tests)
□ Treatment options (surgical vs. watchful waiting)
□ Laparoscopic vs. open surgery (comparison)
□ Surgery preparation (before surgery)
□ Surgery procedure (what to expect)
□ Recovery guide (after surgery)
□ Complications and risks (safety information)
□ Cost and insurance (financial information)
□ FAQ (common questions)

Each page should:
- Link to related pages in the cluster
- Reference the main hub page
- Include expert credentials
- Have quotable statements
```

### Interconnected Content

Create content networks that demonstrate expertise:

```markdown
Hub: General Surgery Services
├── Laparoscopic Surgery
│   ├── Hernia Repair
│   ├── Gallbladder Removal
│   └── Appendectomy
├── Colorectal Surgery
│   ├── Hemorrhoid Treatment
│   └── Anal Fissure
└── Educational Content
    ├── Before Surgery Guide
    └── Recovery Tips

Internal Linking:
- Hub → All subtopics
- Subtopics → Hub
- Related subtopics → Each other
- Educational → Relevant services
```

## Language and Formatting

### Clear, Parseable Writing

```markdown
AI Prefers:
✅ Short sentences (under 25 words)
✅ One idea per paragraph
✅ Active voice ("The surgeon performs" not "The surgery is performed")
✅ Specific numbers ("30 years" not "decades")
✅ Defined terms ("laparoscopic surgery, also called keyhole surgery")

AI Struggles With:
❌ Long, complex sentences
❌ Ambiguous pronouns ("it", "they" without clear referent)
❌ Jargon without explanation
❌ Colloquialisms and idioms
❌ Sarcasm or irony
```

### Multilingual Optimization

For Arabic sites targeting AI:

```markdown
English + Arabic Strategy:

1. Key Terms: Include both languages
"جراحة الفتق (Hernia Surgery)"

2. Names: Include transliterations
"الدكتور معمن الدرانية (Dr. Mu'men Diraneyya)"

3. Location: Both scripts
"عمان، الأردن (Amman, Jordan)"

4. Meta Content: Bilingual where possible
```

## Brand Mention Strategy

5. Hospital/clinic affiliations
6. Conference speaking mentions
7. Medical journal publications
