# Content Gap Analysis Skill

## Purpose
Identify content opportunities that competitors cover but you don't, and discover underserved topics in your niche that have search demand.

## Activation
Use when you need to:
- Find topics competitors rank for that you don't
- Discover underserved content opportunities
- Plan content calendar strategically
- Identify Arabic content gaps in the market
- Build comprehensive topic coverage

## Process

### Step 1: Content Inventory

#### Your Current Content
```
Export or list all your content:
- URL
- Title
- Primary keyword
- Word count
- Last updated
- Content type (blog, service, FAQ, etc.)
- Language (Arabic/English)
- Traffic (if available)
```

#### Competitor Content
```
For top 3-5 competitors:
- Crawl their site or use SEO tool
- List all content pages
- Categorize by topic/type
- Note content that drives traffic
```

### Step 2: Keyword Coverage Analysis

#### Three-Way Comparison
```
Create keyword sets:

YOUR KEYWORDS: Keywords you rank for
COMPETITOR KEYWORDS: Keywords competitors rank for
OVERLAP: Keywords you both rank for

GAP = COMPETITOR KEYWORDS - YOUR KEYWORDS
```

#### Gap Categories
| Category | Description | Priority |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Untapped** | High-volume keywords you don't target | High |
| **Underperforming** | You rank page 2+, competitors rank top 5 | High |
| **Missing subtopics** | You cover topic but miss sub-topics | Medium |
| **Content format gaps** | You have blog, they have video | Medium |
| **Language gaps** | They have Arabic, you only English | High (MENA) |

### Step 3: Topic Cluster Gaps

Map topic coverage:

```
Example: Medical Clinic

Topic Cluster: Hernia Surgery (الفتق)
├── ✅ What is hernia (موجود)
├── ❌ Types of hernia (مفقود)
├── ✅ Laparoscopic hernia surgery (موجود)
├── ❌ Hernia surgery recovery (مفقود)
├── ❌ Hernia surgery cost in Jordan (مفقود)
├── ✅ Symptoms of hernia (موجود)
└── ❌ When to see a doctor for hernia (مفقود)

❌ = Content Gap (prioritize creation)
```

### Step 4: User Intent Gaps

#### Cover All Intent Stages
```
For each core topic, ensure content for:

AWARENESS (Informational)
- What is [topic]?
- [Topic] symptoms
- [Topic] causes

CONSIDERATION (Commercial Investigation)
- Best [solution] for [topic]
- [Treatment A] vs [Treatment B]
- [Topic] options

DECISION (Transactional)
- [Service] cost in [location]
- Book [service] appointment
- [Provider] reviews
```

### Step 5: Arabic Content Gaps

#### Language-Specific Gaps
```
Check for:
1. Topics only covered in English, not Arabic
2. Arabic content with only MSA, missing dialectal terms
3. Content targeting GCC but missing Levant dialect
4. Technical terms only in English
```

#### Arabic Content Opportunities
```
- Medical terminology explanations in simple Arabic
- Procedure guides in Arabic
- FAQ sections in Arabic
- Video transcripts in Arabic
- Location-specific content (Amman, Jordan)
```

### Step 6: SERP Feature Gaps

For each target keyword:
```
| Keyword | Featured Snippet | PAA | Video | Local | Your Content |
|---------|-----------------|-----|-------|-------|--------------|
| | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | None |
| | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | Blog post |
```

### Step 7: Content Quality Gaps

Even for topics you cover, check:

```
Quality Gap Indicators:
- Word count significantly lower than competitors
- Missing visuals (images, videos, diagrams)
- Outdated information (>12 months old)
- No E-E-A-T signals (author, credentials)
- Missing schema markup
- Poor user engagement metrics
- Not answering People Also Ask questions
```

### Step 8: GEO/AI Gaps

```
AI Citation Gaps:
1. Test if AI cites competitors but not you
2. Identify what makes cited content different
3. Check for quotable statements you lack
4. Analyze entity clarity in your content
5. Verify AI can parse your content structure
